### Overview
In this project we will build a static website using Hugo.
Websites are using HTML. Hugo allows to build beutiful websites without the need of knowing HTML.

To start with, we will work with a local website but eventually, we will deploy it to a online repository and make it available for everyone.

### Installation and intial configuration

Follow the Hugo installation steps in here https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#windows.

Next step is to create a blank website and configure it. Apply steps 2 to 6 from https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site.
Step 3 requires git installed to use the theme. We will be using git later but for now, you can simply download the Ananke them as a zip from github https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke/archive/refs/heads/master.zip. Once downloaded, copy the folder into "themes" folder of your website.
