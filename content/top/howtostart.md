## Coding in Minecraft

This section is specific to developing Python projects for Minecraft.

### Minecraft development environment 

The following software needs to be installed on your computer:

* [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Adventures in Minecraft Starter kit (server and libraries)](https://adventuresinminecraft.github.io/)

The process of installation is shown in the video below.

The basic setup and many of the projects we code are based on the fantastic book from David Whale and Martin O'Hanlon ["Adventures in Minecraft"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventures-Minecraft-David-Whale/dp/1119439582/ref=pd_sbs_1/260-6396332-5007359?pd_rd_w=KQvR7&pf_rd_p=a3a7088f-4aec-4dbd-97cc-9a059581fe7b&pf_rd_r=6FRYE8R4XPN907701GM1&pd_rd_r=a8d42608-5ad3-4181-8c40-b39172fb11d7&pd_rd_wg=In4s0&pd_rd_i=1119439582&psc=1). The book provides a lot of useful information about coding in Minecraft and is well worth buying. 

If you are new to programming, it might be useful to start with some of the easier projects described in the book before implementing tutorials from this website.

### PyCharm Edu

It is perfectly ok to use the default Python editor Idle but [PyCharm Edu](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/) is the preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) tool as it provides a lot of useful features and is free for educational purposes.

## Website development environment

### Hugo
Follow Hugo installation steps for Windows as in the video:

Instructions for other operating systems are here https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing.

### Visual Studio Code
A good code  editor will make the web development much quicker. While developing Hugo websites, we will be using Markdown files for defining content of the pages and TOML for configuration. 
A good choice for both of these languages might be [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has out of the box Markdown support and you can easily add "Better TOML" extension from within the tool.
