The basic setup and many of the projects we code are based on the fantastic book from David Whale and Martin O'Hanlon ["Adventures in Minecraft"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventures-Minecraft-David-Whale/dp/1119439582/ref=pd_sbs_1/260-6396332-5007359?pd_rd_w=KQvR7&pf_rd_p=a3a7088f-4aec-4dbd-97cc-9a059581fe7b&pf_rd_r=6FRYE8R4XPN907701GM1&pd_rd_r=a8d42608-5ad3-4181-8c40-b39172fb11d7&pd_rd_wg=In4s0&pd_rd_i=1119439582&psc=1). The book provides a lot of useful information about coding in Minecraft and is well worth buying. 

If you are new to programming, it might be useful to start with some of the easier projects before implementing tutorials from this website.

## PyCharm Edu

It is perfectly ok to use the default Python editor Idle but [PyCharm Edu](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/) is the preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) tool as it provides a lot of useful features and is free for educational purposes.
